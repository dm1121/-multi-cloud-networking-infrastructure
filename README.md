# Multi-Cloud Networking Infrastructure

## Overview

This project demonstrates the setup of a secure, scalable, and highly available multi-cloud networking architecture across **Azure**, **AWS**, and **Oracle Cloud**. It includes network configurations such as virtual networks, routing, firewall policies, and load balancing to create a unified network across the three major cloud platforms.

The project also showcases how to enable cross-cloud communication using VPN gateways and BGP routing, ensuring seamless interconnectivity between different cloud environments.

---

## Features

- **Virtual Networks**: Configuration of Azure VNet, AWS VPC, and Oracle Cloud VCN.
- **Cross-Cloud Routing**: Using BGP and VPN gateways to route traffic across cloud environments.
- **Firewall Policies**: Implementation of security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Load Balancers**: Set up in each cloud to ensure high availability and distribute traffic.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Integration with cloud-native monitoring tools like Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, and Oracle Cloud Monitoring.
- **Automation**: Optionally, use Terraform to automate the deployment of this infrastructure across all clouds.

---

## Prerequisites

- Active accounts in **Azure**, **AWS**, and **Oracle Cloud**.
- Basic knowledge of cloud networking concepts.
- **Terraform** (optional) for infrastructure automation.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Azure Virtual Network Setup
1. Create a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure.
2. Set up subnets and VPN gateways.
3. Configure firewall rules.

Instructions can be found [here](./azure/vnet-setup.md).

### Step 2: AWS Virtual Private Cloud Setup
1. Create a VPC in AWS.
2. Configure VPN gateways and security groups.
3. Set up firewall and NACL rules.

Instructions can be found [here](./aws/vpc-setup.md).

### Step 3: Oracle Cloud Virtual Network Setup
1. Set up a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in Oracle Cloud.
2. Configure FastConnect (or VPN) for routing.
3. Apply firewall policies and security lists.

Instructions can be found [here](./oracle/vcn-setup.md).

### Step 4: Cross-Cloud Routing
1. Set up BGP peering between clouds.
2. Configure routing tables to ensure cross-cloud traffic flow.

Instructions can be found [here](./cross-cloud-routing/bgp-peering.md).
